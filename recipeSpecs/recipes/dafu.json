    "description": "Daifuku is a popular traditional Japanese sweet; it is soft mochi with anko (sweet red bean paste) stuffing.  There are many varieties of Daifuku, but itâ€™s the same soft mochi exterior with different stuffing.  During the spring time, Japanese confectionery shops sells a seasonal Daifuku with a whole strawberry as the filling, called Strawberry Daifuku (Ichigo Daifuku in Japanese).  The combination of fresh soft mochi, sweet anko, and juicy and tart strawberry is a match made in heaven.",
